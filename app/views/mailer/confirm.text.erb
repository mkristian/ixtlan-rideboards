Visitors to the online rideshare board will be able to send you an email to
coordinate sharing a ride with you.  Your email address will not be visible to
them when they do so. You can choose whether to reply to any requests you
receive. You can also use this page to send such message to others. You can
remove yourself from the list at any time by clicking on the 'X' in the Delete
Entry column, and entering this removal code: <%=h @listing.password %>

Please let us know if you have any questions.

With best wishes,
